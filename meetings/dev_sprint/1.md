Date: 

Attendees: Ehsan, Mahdi, Jamshid, Masih, Emad, Farhoud, Mehdi

## Discussion Items

* supporting fula-sec client side encryption to react-native (Jamshid, Mahdi, Farhoud, Mehdi, Ehsan)

  * two issues in go-mobile

    * Go/JS bridge for encryption

    * generating DID entity
      * hermes does not support BigInt

    * storing the password

  * no support for DID in Go

  * issue with JS only implementations

  * should we use Go or Java?


  * Mahdi will list out requirements / missing items

  * https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/jsbi

    * lots of dependendencies

    * performance issues with notification mechanism


* photo sharing
  * persisting DIDs (Jamshid, Farhoud, Mehdi)
    * in DID?
    * this could be easier

  * how the DID is used to encrypt the file

  * generating or importing DIDs on the client

* orbitDb (Mehdi, Farhoud)

  * parent issue - https://github.com/functionland/fula/issues/204

    * avoiding namespace collisions for collections

    * something like unixFS or IPNS for a namespace directory

  * privacy in pools
    * Q: not currrently supported by the protocol but is technically feasible

    * on a use case basis and we need a better list of use cases

      * make the following queryable only by me

        * todo items in a todo list

        * text in a document

        * names tagged in a photo

      * harmonic encryption is too complex and a simpler approach

      * distribution leakage
        * can not see the query results but can see the query

      * how do we make it easy for each application does not require a new API?

        * IPLD schemas (includes other nice primitives such as migrations)

      * https://github.com/ipld/go-ipld-graphql

* AWS dev instances (Aaron)

  * connecting Fula to AWS instance

    * port 443

* testnet launch

  * how are testnet users going to run their own Box?

    * are we shipping them something like a deskpi

    * are we going to ask them to purchase their own Pi and mount a harddrive similar to the writeup Jasper wrote?

  * what UX are testnet users going to use to interact with the vertex testnet?

  * are we going to run any vertext testnet components on the Pi?

* ipfs-cluster requirements (Aaron, Farhoud, Masih)
