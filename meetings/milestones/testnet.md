# Testnet delivery

Attendees: 

Date: June 13, 2022

## Purpose of Testnet 

1.  Find errors and edge cases (especially long lived) before we launch

2.  Gather feedback so we can ensure we are delivering on what is important when we ship

3.  Build community / rapport with 'fx.land fan peeps'

## Directive

* we should not implement anything just for testnet


## Agenda

* what is currently working (demos)

* what the UX should be
  * give option for ec2 or pi or just pi?
  * if Pi we need to figure out key sharing for cluster (send an email suffices?)

* what needs to be done for sufficient UX

* premortem
