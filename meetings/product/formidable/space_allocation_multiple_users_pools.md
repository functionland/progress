## Discussion

Q: How does Functionland break down the division between someone that owns the hardware and someone does not own the hardware?

  * drill down : create a budget on someone's account?
    * other ideas?
    * what are the capabilities to enable certain use cases?

  * can we define relationship between these people?

  * we want not just a person who knows people with a Box to join but also people who do not know anyone

    * the problem with onboarding through apps is then each app would have to have the onboarding process

    * what about having several informal ways (ie/ a telegram and Discord channel) where owners could send tokens to others?


Q: is the trust wallet account synonymous with the entry point to all Functionland apps?

  * I think that is the main direction right now but problem with that is we can't do account recovery

    * what if we offered two layers of security?

      * client side encryption = requires wallet account or some other means of generating a unique password

      * access control = email/password for account recovery

    * the nice thing about that is in a multi-tenant environment people will only lose data associated with their own account


Q: I own a Box and have joined the network and have tokens and are effortlessly mining tokens.

  * how do you as a Box owner mine Fula tokens

Q: What happens to unused space?

  * in a circumstance where we do multi-tenancy, what happens to people's space they are not using?

    * perhaps this could be more of a 'budget' instead of actually allocating space for the user on the hard drive

      eg/ if the administrator sets a budget for a tenant of 10% of their total available space

        * the Box would prevent the tenant from uploading anything else

      * one could also make it so that it is impossible for the Admin to 'budget' for more than 100%

        * eg / let's say there are 4 tenants + 1 admin (assuming they each get an equal share) - they could each have 20% max



Q: Have you thought about what an app store would look like?  How do people install apps?
