# FX.DApp.Dev Team Update no. 1

Date: Mar. 15, 2022

# Summary

In the past few weeks, the fx.dev team has been working towards supporting the upcoming Kickstarter launch.

There are two current work areas - Photos and FULA.

# Work Areas

## Photos

A mobile app BOX customers can use to back up and retrieve their personal photos.

### Success Criteria

Someone downloads the app after watching the Kickstarter video to help them make a decision on wether or not to back the project.

The questions they might ask are:

  1. Is this going to REALLY be able to replace Google Photos for me?

  2. This is obviously a WIP so do I believe the team is capable of delivering on their promise?

Look and feel is a top priority over functionality.

### Key Deliverables

After downloading and opening the app I should be presented with a gallery of all the Photos that are currently present on my device.

I am able to:

  * scroll back in time and have photos that I took years ago appear immediately

  * pinch/zoom the gallery to change the number of columns in the gallery and the transition will be an aesthetically pleasing animation

  * tapping on a photo to zoom in / go back

  * browsing photos with swipe

  * a bottom toolbar with sections to show what will come next

  * other app related items

    * publication in google play app store

    * app icon


## FULA

A platform for helping application developers build 'Web3' DApps.

### Success Criteria

  1.  The Photos app dev. team can integrate with the back-end without having to read anything else.

  2.  A tinkerer that has minimal development experience can open docs.fx.land and write their own app on their own device without having to read anything else.

  3.  An experienced Web2 developer that wants to get involved in Web3 reads our docs and gets excited about our project.

### Key Deliverables

1.  Docs getting started guide

  * setup instructions

  * samples
    * a node.js app to demonstrate uploading a file and working with both the FILE/DATA APIs

    * a plainjs react gallery app to demonstrate working with the FILE/DATA APIs

    * a typescript react gallery app to demonstrate a fully featured CRUD app working with the DATA API

2.  A JS library/sdk + react helper library for interacting with the API

3.  Docs reference for:

  * managing connections

  * FILE/DATA APIs

  * event subscriptions

4.  Event subscriptions

5.  moving/publishing whitepaper into docs

6.  RFCs as drafts for externals

# Previous Work

We have completed some key high priority / high risk deliverables in the Photos project and are on track for completing documentation of FULA as it works today.

We have uncovered several 'Web3 Stack Research/Review' items that will have to be clarified before proceeding with FULA development in order to realize our vision as outlined in the whitepaper.

We have also made progress on a few of these key items:

  * authentication/identity

  * access control 

These  will be presented as part of our RFCs at the end of this milestone.

# Visual Updates / Outcomes

The best places to visually see our work will be:

  1.  The app on the google play app store

  2.  docs.fx.land

# Current Plans

We plan to finish the remaining deliverables for the Kickstarter milestone.

# Non-deliverables

We have been testing out some new project management tools:

  * Geekbot for async daily standups

  * GitHub for a Kanban board
