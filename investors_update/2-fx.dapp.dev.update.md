## Summary

In the past few weeks, the fx.dev team finalized their work for the unbox crowd funding milestone.

The deliverables are a working and usable Fotos app, a Web3 platform for DApp developers called FULA, and a new consolidated docs.fx.land website where backers can come to :

  * learn about what we are doing with the FULA API

  * read our latest whitepaper

  * look at our latest designs for future work in the request for comments section

      * this includes RFCs for

        * decentralized identity

        * two-way encryption

        * establishing ad hoc private networks

        * document syncing between devices

        * personal data reserves

After downloading the Fotos app from the app center, users are able to:

  * pinch and zoom to change the number of columns in the gallery

  * tap on a photo to enter browse mode

  * go back to the gallery with a single gesture

  * scroll back in time and have photos that they took a long time ago appear immediately

  * preview a bottom toolbar with sections to show what will come next

The FULA platform was designed to power the Fotos app as a Web3 decentralized application using open interoperable specifications that include IPFS and libp2p.

It includes several sample apps developers can run quickly and easily with a single docker-compose command.

Once the Box app is running, they can navigate to a browser and enter the PeerId from the docker-compose logs to connect to the Box as a peer in the network.

The TODOs application illustrates making CRUD operatios over graphql and the gallery application illustrates how to use the FILE and GRAPH api in conjunction with each other.

To learn how to the get the samples running and how to work with the FULA client libraries, developers can head over to the getting started section on docs.fx.land.
