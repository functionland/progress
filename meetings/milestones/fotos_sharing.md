## Steps

In this use case we will share a photo between two different devices using the Fotos app (fone A and fone B)

1.  Connect to the same Box from Fotos on each device.

2.  Each device connects Fotos with their own wallet address.

3.  fone A uploads a photo to the Box.

4.  fone B shares DID with fone A

  * from the Fotos account screen, tap on the 'share' icon in the header

  * share the generated DID with fone A through a private channel (eg/ private whatsapp or telegram chat)

5.  fone A shares a photo they uploaded to the Box with fone B

  * from the single image view in Fotos tap the 'share' icon in the header

  * share the generated link with fone B through a private channel (eg/ whatsapp or telegram)

6.  fone B opens the link and the shared image is displayed in Fotos
