## Purpose of Testnet 


1.  Find errors and edge cases (especially long lived) before we launch

2.  Gather feedback so we can ensure we are delivering on what is important when we ship

3.  Build community / rapport with 'fx.land fan peeps'

## Directive
* we should not implement anything just for testnet


## Agenda

* what the UX should be
* what needs to be done for sufficient UX
