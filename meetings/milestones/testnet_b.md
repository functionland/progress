# Testnet Demos

Date: June 20, 2022

## Agenda

1.  What is currently working (demos)

  a ) Mahdi

    * I connect Fotos to a Box.

    * I use 'wallet connect' to generate a DID which I use to encrypt a file before uploading it.

  b ) Mehdi

    * preventing collection name collisions

      * multiple users upload photos to a Box and they can only see the list of photos that they uploaded

    * documentation on sharing.

      * what we have currently working

      * how a developer might extend one of the samples to enable users to share a file with another

      * if it simplifies things we can just share the private key over instant messenger for now


  c ) Farhoud

    * Pin ownership: only I am able to delete my pins from a pool.


2.  What the UX should be?

3.  What needs to be done
