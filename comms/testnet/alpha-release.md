# Testnet Alpha Release Draft Email

Dear `___`,

Thank you for volunteering to help provide us with feedback/testing of the alpha release of the software we have been hard at work with in order to realise the vision as laid out in our whitepaper.

The purpose of getting this into your hands at such an early stage in the release lifecycle is we are hoping you will help us with:

1.  Finding errors and edge cases (especially long lived) before we launch.

2.  Gather feedback so we can ensure we are delivering on what is important when we ship.

3.  Build community / rapport with you (our most important early adopters).

To this last point, we have also created a new [Discourse community](https://community.fx.land) where we are hoping you can network with us Functionlanders as well as other volunteers in the community who share similar ideals to yourself.

Without further adieu, please find instructions on how you can participate in the testnet on our docs portal page [over here](https://docs.fx.land/release/testnet_alpha).
