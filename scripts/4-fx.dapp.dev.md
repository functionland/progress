# Video Script Update No. 4

Good morning, afternoon and evening everyone.

Today is [TBD] and this is a progress update from the Functionland dev team.

In the past month we have continued work on Fotos (a web3 mobile app for backing up and sharing personal photos and video), Box (our reference implementation of the Fula protocol)
as well as Fula itself (a protocol for DApp developers that provides an alternative to working with traditional cloud platforms).


## Docs

On docs.fx.land:

  * developers now have instructions on how they can invoke the fula client side library in their own DApp

and interested outsiders can now read on how blockchain attached storage works - a term coined by the Functionland team.
