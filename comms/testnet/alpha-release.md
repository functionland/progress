# Testnet Alpha Release Draft Email

Dear `___`,

Thanks for your help!

We're contacting you because you volunteered to help provide feedback/testing of our alpha software release.

We're putting this software in your hands at this early stage in the release lifecycle in the hope that you can help us:

1.  Find errors and edge cases (especially long-lived edge cases) prior to launch;

2.  Gather feedback so that we can be sure we're delivering on our promise when we ship;

3.  Build community / rapport with you (our **most important early adopters**).

We also wanted to give all backers an update on our progress by giving them the ability to test things out for themselves.

That covers it!  Ready to get started?  [Here](https://docs.fx.land/release/testnet_alpha) you'll find instructions for participating in the testnet.

Thanks again for joining us on this journey!

Best, Team Functionland
